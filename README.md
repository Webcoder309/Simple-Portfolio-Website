Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my simple portfolio website, featuring a home page and a contact page. It's built using HTML and basic CSS.

Overview

This project showcases my front-end development skills by creating a basic but functional portfolio website. It consists of two main pages:

Home Page: A landing page introducing myself and highlighting key information or projects.

Contact Page: A form or contact information for visitors to reach out.

Technologies Used

HTML: Used for structuring the content of the web pages.

CSS: Implemented basic styling for a clean and presentable interface.

Future Improvements

Enhance the design and layout using more advanced CSS techniques or frameworks.
